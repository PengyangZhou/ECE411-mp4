## Progress report for checkpoint3

For this checkpoint, we finished the implementation as proposed. We implemented arbiter and connected i-cache and d-cache. And we have tested the result for competition codes.

Everyone contributed exactly as planned. While most of the efforts were put into debugging competition codes as we found some unexpected behaviors. Zeduo focused on the cache and arbiter, Pengyang focused on checking the functionality, and Xiwei is still trying to optimize branch predictor.
