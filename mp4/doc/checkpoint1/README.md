[TOC]

### 1. Overview

#### 1.1 Diagram

![diagram](../figures/design_cp1.jpeg)

#### 1.2 CDB definition

`busy` Active high signal indicating there is valid data on the bus.

`tag[3:0]` The index of the ROB entry this data is aiming for.

`val[31:0]` The value of the data.

#### 1.3 Parameters

The number of ROB entries is 6. The number of registers is 32.The number of ALU reservation station entries is 5. The number of Load/Store buffer entries is 5. The number of CMP reservation station entries is 3. The number of instruction queue entries is 6.

#### 1.4 Signals

Note that all module have `clk` and `rst` signals. We ignore mentioning them in this specification.

#### 1.5 Usage of `vcs`

The command below is a perfect example of how to use it.

```
vcs -sverilog -top testbench -full64 hdl/include/rv32i_mux_types.sv hdl/include/rv32i_types.sv hdl/out_of_order_cpu/inst_queue.sv hvl/inst_queue/inst_queue_itf.sv hvl/inst_queue/top.sv
```

Note that the order of these modules matters. Be careful about the dependency.

Another way to simplify your dbugging process is to dump the file options into a single file without postfix, like `inst_queue_tb`. Then execute the following command in the terminal:

```
vcs -sverilog -full64 -f inst_queue_tb
```

You can look into this exact file in `hvl/inst_queue`.

### 2. Branch Predictor

#### 2.1 Port

**Port to instruction queue.**

`pc[31:0]`

The PC value of current instruction.

`pc_next[31:0]`

The next PC value after this instruction. If branch is involved, the pc_next is the jump destination address.

`instruction[31:0]`

The instruction itself.

`br_pred`

Set high if the corresponding instruction is a branch and is predicted as take. Otherwise is low.


**Port from instruction queue**

`iq_ready`

Signal indicating there is empty space in the instruction queue so that new instructions can be loaded.

**Port to cache.**

The memory interface.

`mem_read`

`mem_write`

`mem_byte_enable_cpu[3:0]`

`mem_address[31:0]`

`mem_wdata_cpu[31:0]`

32-bit data bus for sending data *to* the cache.

`mem_resp`

`mem_rdata_cpu[31:0]`

32-bit data bus for receiving data *from* the cache.

**Port from CMP.**

`br_en`

Branch enable signal *from* CMP.

`br_pred_res`

`br_pc[31:0]`

The corresponding PC of the branch instruction. This is used to update the BTB.

#### 2.2 Function

The branch predictor maintains the PC register. 

If opcode is not jal, jalr, branch (6 kinds), PC_next = PC_next + 4. If opcode is jal, PC_next = PC + imm. If opcode is jalr or branch (6 kinds), predict PC_next (always PC_next + 4 in the first version). br_en indicates the branch prediction for B branch.

### 3 Instruction queue

instruction queue entry

#### 3.2 Functionality

The instruction queue takes in the instruction data from the branch predictor and passes it along its internel pipeline.

flush means branch misprediction and all instructions need to be omitted (new PC will be sent to branch predictor and then to instruction queue by PC_next).

If one entry does not hold valid instruction data, its value should be set to 32'b0.

#### 3.3 Implmentation

The instruction queue is a FIFO queue implemented by a shift register and a head pointer.

Also, when any RS entry is requesting for register values that are not yet committed but already exist in the ROB, the ROB should be able to spread out these values.

1. If the instruction to commit is a branch and it is mispredicted, clear ROB and all pending registers. Then fetch the new instruction.
2. If the instruction to commit is a store, `Mem[destination] <- value`. 
3. Else, put the `value` in the `destination` register.
4. In all conditions, free up the tags on the registers that are associated with this ROB entry.

*Note: ROB should support read while write.*

### 11 Load/Store buffer

1. When Load instruction is issued, the immediate part is put into `A` field.
2. For load step 1, when `Vj` is ready the addition between `Vj` and `A` is performed and the result is again stored in `A`. This step can only execute when there are no stores earlier in the Load/Store buffer queue (not necessary?).
3. For load step 2, when load step 1 is done and all stores earlier in the ROB have differnet address.

`
pmem_resp
`

#### 12.2 Functionality

The arbiter will handle the requests from the 2 highest level caches, reasonably distribute the memory resources for them. Instruction fetch has a higher priority than data fetch. As a result, when there is a collision between the two caches, the arbiter should always serve the instruction request first.

### 13 Memory Unit

`valid`

#### 13.2 Functionality

The memory unit resembles the ALU. While ALU executes the operations buffered in ALU reservation station, memory unit handles the memory operations buffered in Load/Store buffer.

1. If all necessary components of a load is ready, the memory unit will calculate the address and send the request to data cache (if it is available). If the data cache is being accessed by ROB during a store commit, the memory unit should wait until the memory write is over.
2. If all necessary components of a store is ready, the memory unit will calculate the effective address and broadcast the address and the data to store on the
